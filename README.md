# Final-DSSA-research-project
Unsupervised clustering and food recommender system using nutrient data from the SmartBites dataset (R-based analysis for DSSA practicum project).
# Final DSSA Research Project: Smart Bites


##  Overview
This project analyzes 8,789 food items to identify healthier alternatives based on nutrient composition. It uses k-means clustering to group foods, PCA and radar charts for interpretation, and cosine similarity to recommend healthier substitutions.

##  Key Features
- Nutrient cleaning and standardization
- Health score formula for ranking
- K-means clustering (k = 3)
- PCA biplot and radar chart visualizations
- Cosine similarityâ€“based recommendation engine

##  How to Run
1. Open `nutrition_analysis.R` in RStudio.
2. Make sure required libraries (e.g., `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `factoextra`) are installed.
3. Run each section or the full script.
4. Outputs will be visible in plots and printed tables.

##  Tools Used
- R (version 4.4.1)
- ggplot2, dplyr, cluster, factoextra, fmsb, corrplot, wordcloud2, proxy
